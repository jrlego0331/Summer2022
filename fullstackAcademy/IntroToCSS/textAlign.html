        Justified text will try to adjust itself 
        so that each line is the same width. 
        This means that we need to add a bit more 
        text here in order to observe the full effect
        rest of this text is just first paragph of 
        Albert Camus's the stranger. Mother died today. 
        Or, maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure. 
        The telegram from the Home says: 
        YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. 
        DEEP SYMPATHY. Which leaves the matter doubtful; 
        it could have been yesterday.
